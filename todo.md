# Mulax Cafe Database Fix

## Phase 1: Re-analyze database initialization and index creation
- [x] Analyze the database error from user input
- [x] Review `app/__init__.py` for database initialization logic
- [x] Review `app/models.py` for index definitions

## Phase 2: Implement a robust database initialization strategy
- [x] Modify `app/__init__.py` to handle `index already exists` error during `db.create_all()`
- [x] Add logic to explicitly drop `ix_notification_logs_timestamp` if it exists
- [x] Ensure `create_default_users` is called after successful table creation/handling

## Phase 3: Test the new database initialization
- [x] Delete existing database file to simulate fresh start
- [x] Run the application and verify it starts without database errors
- [x] Verify default users are created (check logs)
- [x] Test application functionality (e.g., login, dashboard)

## Phase 4: Deliver the updated application and instructions
- [ ] Package the updated application
- [ ] Provide clear instructions on how to use the updated application
- [ ] Explain the changes made to the database initialization
